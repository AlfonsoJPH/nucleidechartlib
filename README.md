# nucleidechartlib

Student: Alfonso Jesús Piñera Herrera
Professor: Andrés Roldán Aranda

This project is a Python library that generates SVG nuclide charts in standard A paper format from a user-provided database.

## Description

The main goal of this project is to facilitate the generation of nuclide charts, a crucial tool in various fields of nuclear physics and nuclear engineering. Nuclide tables provide information about the isotopes of chemical elements, including their mass, atomic number, neutron number, half-life, among other relevant data.

The tool takes as input a nuclide database in a specific format and generates a formatted table that can be printed on standard A paper. This is especially useful for use in laboratories, academic institutions, and companies involved in nuclear research.

## Features

- **Nuclide Table Generation**: The tool is capable of generating complete nuclide charts from a user-provided database.
- **Standard A Paper Format**: The generated charts have a format optimized for printing on standard A size paper, making them suitable for physical environments.
- **Customization**: Users can customize the appearance and content of the generated charts according to their specific needs.
